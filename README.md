#  Vulnerable Login App ‚Äì Cyber Combat Demo

This is a **deliberately vulnerable login system** built using Flask and SQLite for a red team vs blue team simulation. It was created as part of a cybersecurity combat challenge to demonstrate common authentication flaws and give attackers (like Lyna üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) a chance to practice real-world exploitation techniques such as SQL Injection.

---

##  Objective

The app is designed to:
- Simulate a **badly built login system**.
- Allow attackers to **bypass authentication**.
- Showcase **classic web security vulnerabilities**.
